# `<Panel3 />`

![panel3-saturation](../../../images/panel3-saturation.png) < or > ![panel3-brightness](../../../images/panel3-brightness.png)

- The circle-shaped slider, with its wheel style design, is utilized to adjust the hue and (saturation or brightness) of colors.

- Move thumb (handle) around the center to change the color's hue.

- Move thumb (handle) away or toward the center to change  the saturation or the brightness of the color, depending on the `verticalChannel` prop..

:::tip

If you want to give your users more control over the color selection, you can add another slider next to this one that adjusts the opposite channel. For example, if `centerChannel` is `"saturation"`, you can add a [`<BrightnessSlider />`](./BrightnessSlider) slider, and vice versa.
