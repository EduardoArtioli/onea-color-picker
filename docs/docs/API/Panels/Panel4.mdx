# `<Panel4 />`

![panel4](../../../../images/panel4.png)

- A slider with a square shape is used to adjust the channels of hue, saturation, and brightness.

- To adjust the color's saturation and brightness, move the handle horizontally..

- Move the handle vertically to change the color's hue.

:::danger

This panel cannot show all colors because it has a limited range of colors it can display. For example, if the input color has 50% saturation and 50% brightness, the panel thumb (handle) location wonâ€™t be accurate because it cannot show that color. This means that the color you select may not be exactly what you see in the panel.
